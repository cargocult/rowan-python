Basic Controllers
=================

Rowan provides a basic set of controllers out of the box. These controllers 
cover the basic compositional needs of a tree structure. There could be
many tens of other controllers with more specific needs, and even with
those there would be a large number of controllers that need to be
written new for each project, because they contain project specific logic.

This set is intended to provide the bare-bones structure.
