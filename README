Rowan Framework


Rowan is a simple Microframework for Python using the WSGI standard.

It is designed as an experiment in creating a framework based around a
tree-structure, as used in (particularly game) AI.

Each element in the tree has the same structure: it takes a request
object and either returns a response object or raises an
error. Branches in the tree might dispatch a request based on a URL,
for example, or might have a fallback in case their preferred child
node raises an error.

The request object is also particularly interesting, any piece of data
is stores can be temporarily overridden. Because the access to all
data is via these request objects, nodes in the tree can effectively
change the execution context for their children. This allows subtrees
to be more extensively reused without further customization: they can
just set the properties they need to run, and inherit anything they
don't have a strong opinion about.

The software is being uploaded as an illustration of what I'm
thinking about. It isn't intended to be either finished, or
production ready.

The code was originally written to use the Django webframework as a
service provider (using its template language, and ORM, for
example). Recently, however, I've started replacing these with Jinja2
and SQLAlchemy. The example provided in the source code requires
Jinja2, which you can install with:

$ easy_install jinja2
