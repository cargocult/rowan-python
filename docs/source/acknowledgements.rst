Inspiration
-----------

Rowan draws its technical inspiration from two sources.

Firstly from Behavior Trees and Decision Trees in (particularly
game) Artificial Intelligence. For more information on these, and how
they are used in game development, you could always read my book on
game AI. 

Millington, Ian and Funge, John `Artificial Intelligence for Games, Second Edition <http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Games-Second-Millington/dp/0123747317>`_. Morgan Kaufmann. 2009.

Secondly it draws its inspiration from frameworks such as Ruby on
Rails, and particularly Django. I work with Django a lot, and I was
one of the co-founders of `Lamp Training
<http://www.lamptraining.com>`_, a company that provides commercial
training in Django (amongst many other programs) to some of the
world's largest and more exciting companies.

Some of the naming I've used is drawn from Django, but other than that
there is no direct overlap. The original version of Rowan used various
Django elements extensively. Recently, however, I've come to use more
Jinja and SQLAlchemy for their increased flexibility.


The Name
--------

The name `Rowan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan>`_ is supposed to
evoke two things: the fact that the framework is based on a tree
structure; and the fact there is some magic (in the good sense, not
the bad sense) going on.

Rowan wood is the subject of many myths concerning its magical
properties and is used for that reason by practitioners of neopagan
religions. I don't go in for that kind of thing personally, but its a
nice tie in.
