Inspiration
-----------

Rowan draws its technical inspiration from two sources.

Firstly from Behavior Trees and Decision Trees in (particularly
game) Artificial Intelligence. For more information on these, and how
they are used in game development, you could always read my book on
game AI. 

Millington, Ian. `Artificial Intelligence for Games <http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0124977820?ie=UTF8&tag=idmme-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0124977820>`_. Morgan Kaufmann. 2006.

The updated second edition (co-written with John Funge) should be
out before the end of the year.


Secondly it draws its inspiration from frameworks such as Ruby on
Rails, and particularly Django. I work with Django a lot, and I'm part
owner of `Lamp Training <http://www.lamptraining.com>`_, a company
that provides commercial training in Django (and other web development
topics) to some of the world's largest companies.

Some of the naming I've used is drawn from Django, but other than
that there is no direct overlap. The original version of Rowan
used various Django elements extensively. Recently, however, I've
come to use more Jinja and SQLAlchemy for their increased
flexibility.


The Name
--------

The name `Rowan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan>`_ is supposed to evoke two
things: the fact that the framework is based on a tree structure; and the fact
there is some magic (in the good sense, not the bad sense) going on.

Rowan wood is the subject of many myths concerning its magical
properties and is used for that reason by practitioners of neopagan
religions. I don't go in for that kind of thing personally, but its a nice
tie in.
