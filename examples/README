This directory contains example web applications that your can run to 
show the framework in operation. Each directory holds a file called wsgi.py
which can be used from a WSGI compliant interface, or can be run as a 
script (they boot Python's wsgiref server for testing).

They are intended to be run by executing the wsgi.py script from a 
command line:

% python examples/one_file/wsgi.py

Each example tries to find the rowan source code if it hasn't previously
been placed on the python path.

Each example has a root.py file in which the root controller of the sample is
defined (called 'root' by convention). If you want to use a sample as part of a
bigger project, just use that root controller in a bigger controller tree.

Examples might use third party libraries. In particular I'm using: Jinja2 and
SQLAlchemy.
