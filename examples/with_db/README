This example uses both Jinja2 and SQLAlchemy. It is configured to use a
sqlite3 database by default, but should work with a more complex query string.

The file naming is borrowed from Django, so models are in models.py and the URL
routing instructions are in urls.py. Because we call 'views' something 
different in Rowan, there is no views.py file - controllers are placed in 
controllers.py

To create the database tables and populate them with some random initial data,
run the models.py file as a script. You can then run the server (wsgi.py) and
view the created entries on the root url.
