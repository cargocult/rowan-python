This example uses both Jinja2 and SQLAlchemy. It is configured to use a
sqlite3 database by default, but should work with a more complex query string.

The file naming is borrowed from Django, so models are in models.py, individual
page handlers are in views.py, and the URL routing instructions are in urls.py.

To create the database tables and populate them with some random initial data,
run the models.py file as a script. You can then run the server (wsgi.py) and
view the created entries on the root url.
